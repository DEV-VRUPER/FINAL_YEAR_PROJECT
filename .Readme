Abstract — This paper’s study is the development of the mobile phone game based on Android OS. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an Android game we will develop, called Sammy. In this game the player will select between available tiles to create a path for Sammy to reach to his home from school. Sammy is developed for mobile devices with the Android mobile operating system. The tool used for developing this game is Unity 3D game engine. The game will also have an A.I. player which the player can play against. Nowadays mobile gaming market is growing rapidly and is expected to be a $16 billion business by 2016. Almost all Android devices will be able to successfully run the game. We hope that sharing our experiences will assist others who wish to either use our mobile game or develop their own. Our research seeks to adding values and enjoyment to users of the Android mobile devices.
